# Responsive CSS Grid Website

This project was built as my attempt to create an optimized, responsive website using SCSS and Gulp.

Gulp was used in production for:
* Compiling SCSS
* Browser Sync with HTML and SCSS code updates
* Optimizing Images for better load performance

The layout was built using CSS Grid. 

***The design was inspired by Brad Traversy from Traversy Media.
